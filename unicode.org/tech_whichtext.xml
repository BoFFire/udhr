  <title>Which text?</title>

  <para>For the English and French translations, which are the
  official languages in which the UDHR was originally published, we
  used the text as originally published.</para>

  <para>For the translations which are present on the OHCHR site, we
  would like to represent those texts as precisely as possible. The
  corrections are limited to the repair of encoding corruption, and
  fixing what are obviously and unquestionably typos.</para>

  <para>For other translations, we try to find authoritative sources
  and represent those authoritative sources as precisely as
  possible.</para>

  <para>When there are changes of orthography (e.g. Romanian), we do
  not update the original translation with the new orthography; rather
  we create a new translation for it.</para>
