  <title>UDHR in Unicode</title>

  <para>The goal of the <emphasis>UDHR in Unicode</emphasis> project
  is to demonstrate the use of Unicode for a wide variety of
  languages, using the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as
  a representative text. The UDHR was selected because it is available
  in a large number of languages, in particular from the Office of the
  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) at <ulink
  url='http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/'/>.</para>

  <para>You can access the translations by the map below (HTML version only) or by the <ulink url='translations.html'>table of translations</ulink> (XML, plain text, HTML, etc.) You can also access some <ulink url='aggregates.html'>aggregate documents</ulink> showing all or part of the translations. Or you can consult the underlying Github repository <ulink url='https://github.com/unicode-org/udhr'>unicode-org/udhr</ulink>.</para>

  <para>You are encouraged to contribute to this project by reviewing
  existing translations or by providing new ones. Many thanks to those
  who already <ulink url='contributors.html'>contributed!</ulink></para>

  <para><emphasis>August 30, 2022:</emphasis> Removal of the “character count”. This was an attempt at collecting the character usage across languages. However, the UDHR is much too small and narrow to provide useful data.</para>

  <para><emphasis>August 25, 2022:</emphasis> Corrections to the Japanese (Osaka) [jpn_osaka] translation, thanks to xekri.</para>
