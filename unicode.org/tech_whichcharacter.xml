  <title>Which characters?</title>

  <para>In general, there is no ambiguity in the selection of Unicode
  characters to represent a given text. However, there are few
  situations which are a bit more delicate. Below are the generally
  applicable rules we follow; for rules which are specific to a
  language, see the notes for that language (accessible the
  translation lists).</para>

  <para>The rules we follow are not necessarily universal: they are
  designed to work well for the text of the UDHR, which is entirely
  ordinary text (no math, etc).</para>

  <para>We use U+0020 &#x2018;&#x0020;&#x2019; SPACE ambiguously for
  all spaces, and do not use U+00A0 &#x2018;&#x00A0;&#x2019; NO-BREAK
  SPACE or U+202F &#x2018;&#x202F;&#x2019; NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE.</para>

  <para>We prefer to not use U+002D &#x002D; HYPHEN-MINUS because it
  is an ambiguous character. Instead, we use U+2010 &#x2010; HYPHEN or
  U+2013 &#x2013; EN DASH as appropriate. Another related character is
  U+2212 &#x2212; MINUS SIGN, but there is no need for it in the
  UDHR. (Note: not all translations have been updated to follow this
  rule).</para>

  <para>The texts are in no particular normal form.</para>
