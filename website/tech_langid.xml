  <title>Language identification</title>

  <para>We identify the languages using the Ethnologue codes, 15th
  edition. When there are multiple translations for a single language
  (e.g. different orthographies, or dialects), our code is the
  Ethnologue code, followed by an underscore, followed by some
  indication of the version (as in &#x201C;aka_akuapem&#x201D;).</para>

  <para>We use only the Ethnologue primary language names, may be followed by a
  qualifier in parenthesis: for example &#x201C;Akan
  (Akuapem)&#x201D;.</para>

  <para>We do not provide an exhaustive index by alternate
  language names. For example, the Ethnologue uses "Gaelic, Irish" as
  the primary language name and provides "Irish", "Erse", "Gaeilge" as
  alternate names. In our index, the Irish translation will be found
  only under "Gaelic, Irish". If you have difficulty finding a
  translation by language name, you may want to use the <ulink
  url="http://ethnologue.com">Ethnologue</ulink> to determine the
  primary language name.</para>

  <para>We have a few translations for which we could not ascertain
  the corresponding Ethnologue language. For those, we use 3-digits
  identifiers, and names in parenthesis. Any help in identifying the
  language of those translations is welcome.</para>

  <para>In the list of translations, we also give the code used by the
  OHCRH, for cross-reference purposes. Those are largely based on the
  Ethnologue codes, 14th edition, but not entirely.</para>
