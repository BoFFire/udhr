  <para>The source form of our translations is XML.  We have
  designed a simple set of &#x201C;tags&#x201D; to capture the
  organization of UDHR. We have a Relax-NG schema: in <ulink
  url='d/schema.rnc'>rnc</ulink> syntax and in <ulink
  url='d/schema.rng'>rng</ulink> syntax.</para>

  <para>The encoding of our files is UTF-8, with or without numeric
  character entities.</para>

  <bridgehead id='plaintext'>Plain text files</bridgehead>

  <para>The plain text files are encoded in UTF-8, and produced from
  the XML files by applying <ulink url='assemblies/udhrs2txt.xsl'>this
  XSLT stylesheet</ulink>.</para>
